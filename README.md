# my_interconnect

Various personal scripts to interconnect various home devices; MQTT,
infra-red, rf433, etc.

Code forked from https://github.com/irontoby/shuttleit as this originated
as a client for using ShuttleXpress devices as remotes for existing home
tech, but morphed into more than that.

I hope to get around to documenting this stuff better in future.  However,
personal health issues have set a solid deadline for me: I'm building all
this home automation stuff to support me after major spine surgery at the
end of January 2017!  As a result, pretty, neat, generic code is NOT a
priority for me at the moment.
